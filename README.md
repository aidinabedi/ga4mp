# GA4MP - Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol

This is an open-source implementation for the *client-side* protocol used by **Google Analytics 4**. When I mention "**client-side**" is because it must be differentiated with the official [GA4 Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4) offered by Google.

This library implements the public **Google Analytics 4** protocol to make possible to do a full server-side tracking using NODE/JS which is not actually possible with the official **Measurement Protocol** , which is meant only to augment the current GA4 data and it's not ready for doing a full tracking.

Main differences with the official offerser server-side protocol are:

- Trigger new sessions and visits starts
- Track Sessions attribution
- Override the User IP to populate the GEO Details
- View the hits on the DebugView
- Override ANY value you want
- Easily portable to other languages

If we compare this library with the official GTAG implementation.

 - Lightweight 8.7kb (<4kb compressed ) 95.6% Lighter than a GTAG Container

 - Privacy Compliant: Full control over which cookies are created/read and sent to Google
 - Dual Tracking (send hits to multiple measurement Ids)
